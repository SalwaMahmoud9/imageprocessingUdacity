Highlighted changes and suggestions include:
    Arranging dependencies correctly.(done)
        supertest, jasmine, @types packages and jasmine-spec-reporter must be a part of devDependencies.
        Ideally you should only have express and sharp as dependencies and rest as devDependencies.
        It is very important to keep dependencies separate from devDependencies.
        DevDependencies are used when you only need the packages for development.
        They are not used in testing like jasmine, supertest etc.
        In fact, you would not even need type definition support for any package since the production code would be build code that is written in javascript.
    Separating out image processing function.(i have created processing.ts to use sharp funcs)
        Image processing is not done in a separate module.
        Separating functionality is important to keep the code modular.
        It helps to debug the code in a much better way when you know where to look exactly for a particular function.
    Including test specs for image processing.
        Test specs for image processing are missing.
        By image processing, the rubric is trying to convey that you need to directly import the function and perform testing.
        A test spec for image processing would look like
        expect(async () => {
                await transform(testFilePath, testWidth, testHeight, testThumbPath);
            }).not.toThrow();
        where transform is the function where image processing is performed.
        (i have added this:
        expect(async () => {await processing.resizeFunc(requestData.filename,'.jpg', Number(requestData.width), 
        Number(requestData.height),imageNameThumb);}).toBeTruthy();)
    Defining return type and including type parameters for functions and callbacks.
        use this images.get('/', (req: Request, res: Response): void 
        instead of images.get('/', (req, res)
